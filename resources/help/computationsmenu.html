<b>Computations|Enable wells</b>
Enable selected wells. These wells will be taking into account for all calculations. 
</p>
<p><img src=":/disable.png">
<b>Computations|Disable wells</b>
Disable selected wells. These wells will NOT be taking into account for all calculations.

<b>Computations|Standard Curves</b>
Compute results of standard sample to plot standard curves and to calculate PCR
efficiency. If you want PCR efficiency taking into account in relative quantification
calculation, be careful to compute first standard curves and secondly
quantifications. If not, efficiency is 100% by default. In absolute quantification mode, standard curves should be computed before quantifications.

<b>Computations|Quantifications</b>
Compute results to give relative quantification of targets between the
differents samples or absolute quantification based on the standard curves (depending on settings, see <b><a href="settingsmenu.html">Settings menu</a></b>).
