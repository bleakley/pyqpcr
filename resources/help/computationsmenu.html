<b>Computations|Enable wells</b>
Enable selected wells. These wells will be taking into account for all calculations. 
</p>
<p><img src=":/disable.png">
<b>Computations|Disable wells</b>
Disable selected wells. These wells will NOT be taking into account for all calculations.
</p>

<b>Computations|Standard Curves</b>
Compute results of standard sample to plot standard curves and to calculate PCR
efficiency. If you want PCR efficiency taking into account in quantification
calculation, be careful to compute first standard curves and secondly
quantifications. If not, efficiency is 100% by default.

<b>Computations|Quantifications</b>
Compute results to give relative quantification of targets between the
differents samples.
