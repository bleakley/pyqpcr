<b>Extract sub-plates</b>
After selecting the wells you want in the open plate, by clicking on this
button you can create a new sub-plate consisting in selected wells only. This
function is useful for instance when you share a plate with a collegue and want
to treate your data separately. After extraction, the original plate should be
deleted to not be taken into account for subsequent calculations.
