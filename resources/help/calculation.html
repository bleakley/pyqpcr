<b>Problem in calculation !</b> 
<p>
A problem occured in the calculations. It seems to come from the well ['A1']. Check if ct is correctly defined. 
All the well with a target and a sample (or an amount for standard samples) defined are taking into account for calculation. 
If one of these well miss the ct value, the calculation is aborted. 
To solve the trouble, disable the well in the <a href="computationsmenu.html">Computations menu</a> | <img src=":/disable.png"> Disable wells, 
or right click on the well and select Disable wells. After that, run the calculation again.
