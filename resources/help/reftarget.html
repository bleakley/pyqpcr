<b>Reference target undefined!</b> 
<p>
The reference target is not defined. To solve the trouble, select <img
src=":/addgene.png"> Add target in the <a href="editmenu.html">Edit menu</a>. 
This opens a window that shows the list of the targets. There is no target
marked with <img src=":/reference.png">, which means that there is no reference
target. 
Select the target you want as the reference and click on Edit. Then check the
reference box and validate by OK. The target of reference is now marked with
<img src=":/reference.png">. Validate and run the calculation again.
